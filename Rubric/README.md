# Instructions
Evaluate the homework against the outlined criteria in the below rubric, 
assigning a rating to each criterion. Add points earned across all criteria
and convert the total points to a letter grade, assigning a “+” or “-” letter
grade designation at your discretion.
### Discovered Phenomenon Visualizations
* The submitted Tableau workbook includes all of the following:
  * 4-10 total visualizations
  * A total of 2 dashboards (1 for each phenomenon)
  * Data is cleaned (i.e. No outliers or bad data)
  * Visualizations can logically be used to discover the solved phenomenon (i.e. they are not just random visualizations)
### City Official Requested Maps (Grade based on the map the student chose to make.)
#### Basic:
* Visualization includes all of the following:
  * Maps all bike stations
  * Station markers indicate popularity in some way (color, size,etc.)
  * Sections are marked by zip code 
  * A write-up on the trends that were discovered while making the map
#### Advanced:
* Visualization includes all of the following:
  * Maps all bike stations
  * Station markers indicate popularity in some way (color, size, etc.)
  * Ability to change marker data based on month and year
  * Sections are marked by zip code
  * A write-up on the trends that were discovered while making the map

### Presentation
The Tableau story includes all of the following:
✓ Phenomenon visualizations
✓ Phenomenon dashboards
✓ One of the city official’s requested maps
✓ Arranged in a logical order (i.e. Visualizations for each phenomenon with each other, not all mixed up.)

### Analysis 
The submitted analysis should include all of the following:
✓ Analysis on both uncovered phenomena, using the dashboards as a visual guide.
✓ Analysis on the chosen city official requested map detailing any noticeable trends
✓ Both write-ups are logically sound
✓ Write-ups are written in a manner that a non-data scientist/analyst could understand.
