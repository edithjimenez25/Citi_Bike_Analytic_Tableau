## Citi Bike Speed

* Citi Bikes are hefty and designed to move at moderate speeds.

* Todd Schneider, an engineer at Genius, analyzed 22 million Citi Bike rides and found that average speeds for Citi Bikes was about 8.3 miles per hour. The average speed on a regular bike is 11 to 12 miles per hour, observations of bike lanes in St. Petersburg, Florida.

* Bicycle crashes happen because of a combination of factors, but studies have shown that slower speeds, especially along intersections with limited visibility, make for safer commutes.
